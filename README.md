# What I am Most Proud of in the Assignment

I am quite happy with the overall look and feel of the game. While it is isn't a super refined looking game the little animations I made for things turned out really well and I am quite happy about that.

# What I learned

I learned a wide array of things in this project, namely "_" being used to make functions private, thus it not having it making public, which was an incredibly useful tool for building my game, and any future games to come.

Regrowth has a variety of basic platforming elements. While these mechanics are basic such as your basic run and jump, Regrowth has acceleration and deacceleration, on top of having to shorten you jump by releasing the jump button before reaching the apex of your jump. As well as that, Regrowth features an omni-directional wand that fires sun blasts to make your roommate happy. The game being an infinite runner features, well an infinite path of platforms for you to travel down, with collectibles and enemies to boot, if you're skilled enough there is no end! Lastly, Regrowth features an enemy that may spawn on platforms that walks across the platform till he either falls off the platform, goes off your screen, is cured by your sun blasts, or runs into you ending the game.
